# Challenges & Oppurtunities

## 5G Offerings
 cloud computing, edge computing, cloud RAN, hybrid RAN, AI, ML

## Challanges
* Cell phones and consumers simply don't require 1Gbps throughput. No consumer ROI, no 5G.
* Nor can any carrier deliver 1Gbps consistently and ubiquitously over mmWave
* Operators are trailing behind

## Oppurtunities

## Way Forward
* AI generation will trigger the 5G adoption
* Smart phones should be good enough to handle AI application workloads
* SaaS based applications are good promoters for 5G
* Phones might come with lesser computational power and offload their work to cloud, which inturn requires more bandwidth
* Data network enabled with more edge capabilities
* OEMs tilted towards : '5G platform as a service'
* Tier3 and Tier4 TSPs may use 5G Infrastructure as a service
* Generative AI based bandwidth prediction
